# Netflix-clone
# Overview
This project is a basic home page clone of netflix, created as a part of my CSS and HTML learning journey. It serves as a demonstration of my understanding of front-end development using these technologies. Please note that this is a static demo page, and certain features such as links and buttons are non-functional.

# Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file representing the home page.
styles.css: The CSS file containing the styles for the page.
# Important Note
Functionality: This is a static demo, and features like links and buttons are not operational.
Completeness: Due to the enormity of the netflix website, this clone is a basic representation, and some elements #may be missing.
 # Ongoing Development:
 This project is a work in progress, and enhancements will be made over time to improve its functionality and completeness.

# Usage
Feel free to explore the project by opening the index.html file in a web browser. Since this is a static representation, you won't be able to perform actual transactions or navigate to other pages as you would on the official netflix website.

# Future Development
I plan to enhance this project by implementing additional features, improving the user interface, and making it more interactive. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to develop and refine this netflix clone.
